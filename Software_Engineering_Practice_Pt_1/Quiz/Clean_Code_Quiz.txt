Question 1:
Imagine you are writing a program that executes a number of tasks and categorizes each task based on its execution time. 
Below is a small snippet of this program. Which of the following naming changes could make this code cleaner?

t = end_time - start  # compute execution time
c = category(t)  # get category of task
print('Task Duration: {} seconds, Category: {}'.format(t, c)

Ans:
- Rename the variable start to start_time to make it consistent with end_time
- Rename the variable t to execution_time to make it more descriptive
- Rename the function category to categorize_task to match the part of speech
- Rename the variable c to category to make it more descriptive

Question 2:
Imagine you analyzed several stocks and calculated the ideal price, or limit price, 
you'd want to buy each stock at. You write a program to iterate through your stocks and 
buy it if the current price is below or equal to the limit price you computed. 
Otherwise, you put it on a watchlist. Below are three ways of writing this code. 
Which of the following is the most clean?

# Choice A
stock_limit_prices = {'LUX': 62.48, 'AAPL': 127.67, 'NVDA': 161.24}
for stock_ticker, stock_limit_price in buy_prices.items():
    if stock_limit_price <= get_current_stock_price(ticker):
        buy_stock(ticker)
    else:
        watchlist_stock(ticker)
		
# Choice B
prices = {'LUX': 62.48, 'AAPL': 127.67, 'NVDA': 161.24}
for ticker, price in prices.items():
    if price <= current_price(ticker):
        buy(ticker)
    else:
        watchlist(ticker)
		
# Choice C
limit_prices = {'LUX': 62.48, 'AAPL': 127.67, 'NVDA': 161.24}
for ticker, limit in limit_prices.items():
    if limit <= get_current_price(ticker):
        buy(ticker)
    else:
        watchlist(ticker)

Ans:
Choice C
